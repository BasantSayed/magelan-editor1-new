	Extensions (along with entities) are a pivotal element of the Magelan framework. 
	The establishment of a simple and compact model for extensions has always been
	a top priority during the development of this project. All toolbar commands, 
	(except for the ones in the <b>File</b> toolbar) and even the <b>Properties</b> 
	editor table, layer and linestyle controls are extensions. Everyone can easily
	create new extensions to improve the functionality of the editor and solve 
	specific problems of their own.

	All extensions extend the <code>AbstractEditorExtension</code> class, which in turn
	is a subclass of Swing's <code>AbstractAction</code> class. Extensions are loaded
	by the editor and typically placed in the extensions toolbar and menu as buttons.
	The buttons and menu items will be automatically constructed and maintained by 
	the GUI. Note that in order to be successfully instantiated by the editor 
	extensions must have a public default constructor. Extensions also have to use the 
	following methods:
	<p>
	
	<p class="sub"><code>public Object getValue(String key)</code></p>
	<p class="sub"><code>public void setValue(String key, Object value)</code></p>
	<p>
	This pair of methods is defined by the <code>AbstractAction</code> class to
	allow manipulating of the properties used to visualize an <code>Action</code>.
	The extension manager will recognize and use the properties listed below: <p>
	
	<table border=0>
	<tr><td valign=top><code>Action.NAME</code></td>
	<td valign=top>The name that will be used to identify the extension. (Note: the string 
	should not be internationalized!)</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>Action.SMALL_ICON</code></td>
	<td valign=top>An <code>ImageIcon</code> to represent the extension in toolbars and menus.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>AbstractEditorExtension.GROUP</code></td>
	<td valign=top>The group the extension belongs to. Extensions are placed in different menus and toolbars
	in accordance with the value of this property.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>Action.SHORT_DESCRIPTION</code></td>
	<td valign=top>Short extension description to be shown as a tooltip.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>Action.LONG_DESCRIPTION</code></td>
	<td valign=top>Long extension description to be shown in the status bar.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>Action.ACCELERATOR_KEY</code> and <code>Action.MNEMONIC_KEY</code></td>
	<td valign=top>The keys to be used for extension invocation.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>AbstractEditorExtension.VERSION</code></td>
	<td valign=top>Version information.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td valign=top><code>AbstractEditorExtension.AUTHOR</code></td>
	<td valign=top>Information about the provider of the extension.</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	
	
	<p class="sub"><code>public void run(DrawingEditor e)</code></p>
	<p>
	The editor GUI will call this method when the extension has to be invoked. 
	The parameter <code>DrawingEditor</code> will point to the currently selected editor
	or <code>null</code>, if no such editor.
	<p>
	
	
	<p class="sub"><code>public Component getComponent()</code></p>
	<p>
	Some methods may need to provide more complex functionallity that cannot 
	be represented with a button. In such cases the extensions must override this
	method to return their desired custom component. Depending on its type it
	will be placed in the toolbars or in the tab panel on the left (if is an instance 
	of <code>JScrollPane</code>).

	<p class="title"><a name="mf">Manifests</a></p>
	<p>
	Manifests are plain text files (.mf or .manifest) containing information
	about extension's class name, paths to the required libraries or classes (if any),
	path to its help file and some human-readable tips about extension's functionallity.
	<p>
	The editor will read such manifest files and construct the extensions described by
	them. An example manifest file follows:<p>
	
	<table border=0 width=100%
	<tr><td valign=top><code>
	# Demo Class Manifest File<br>
	# Mon Jul 07 01:15:37 CEST 2003<br>
	<br>
	# extension's full class name<br>
	ClassName=myprojects.magelan.extension.MyExtension<br>
	<br>
	# libraries needed to load the extension class<br>
	ClassPath=.\\extension\\MyExtensionSuite.jar<br>
	<br>
	# some hints on extension's purpose<br>
	Info=A very powerful and secret extension.<br>
	<br>
	# path to extension's help file<br>
	HelpPath=.\\extension\\line.html<br>
	<br>
	# may be omitted<br>
	Created-By=<br>
	Manifest-Version=1.0<br>
	</code></td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	
	Note that the paths are given relative to editor's working directory, which is 
	the root directory of the extracted distribution package. 
	Also note that the usage of \ or / path separators is platform specific.

	<p>
	After an extension has been created, compiled and located in a certain directory,
	a manifest file describing it must be created. The default (and preferred) place for extensions and 
	their manifest files is currently the <b>/extension</b> folder. Extensions and 
	manifests are handled by the <b>Extensions | Manage</b> dialog from editor's main 
	menu bar. 
	<p>
	<img src="extmanager2.gif">
	<p>
	There are two ways to tell the editor about a manifest file from the extensions 
	manager dialog:
	<p>
	
	<p class="sub">Declaring a Single Manifest</p>
	<p>
	Select the <b>Manifests</b> tab and add the manifest file name to the list
	of known manifests. If the file cannot be located an error icon will appear next
	to its name. The order of the manifest files (which is also the order they will
	be loaded and placed in the toolbars the next time the editor is started) can be 
	changed by dragging them with the right mouse button. To edit a manifest, choose 
	the <b>Edit</b> button
	<p>
	<img src="manifests.gif">
	<p>
		
	<p class="sub">Declaring Multiple Manifests</p>
	<p>
	Select the <b>Paths</b> tab and add the directory the manifest file is
	located in. Again if the directory cannot be found an error icon will appear next
	to it. 
	<p>
	<img src="mfpaths.gif">
	<p>
	To add all manifests located in the listed directories to the list of
	known manifests, choose the <b>Scan</b> button. This option is useful for 
	deployment of multiple extensions.
	<p>
	
	<p class="sub">Automatic Loading of Extensions</p>
	<p>
	If the <b>extensions.autoload</b> option from the <b>Preferences | Edit Workspace</b>
	dialog is selected the editor will ignore the manifests listed in the <b>Manifests</b>
	tab of the extension manager dialog. It will instead scan the directories listed
	in the <b>Paths</b> tab (much as the <b>Scan</b> button will) for manifest files 
	and load the corresponding extensions. The drawback is that the user could not 
	influence the order the extensions will appear in the editor the next time it is 
	started. This option is turned off by default.
	<p>

	<p class="title"><a name="examples">Examples</a></p>
	<p>
	
	<p class="sub">Color Chooser</p>
	<p>
	The actual color chooser extension. When extension's button is pressed the standard
	color chooser dialog appears. If there are no entities selected the current color
	is changed, if there are entitites selected their color is changed. If the choosing
	is cancelled the respective color property is set to ByLayer.
