The aim of the path extension is to give the user the ability to
create paths equivalent to the paths in SVG.
<p>
A path in SVG is described using the concept of a current point.
In an analogy with drawing on paper,
the current point can be thought of as the location of the pen.
The position of the pen can be changed, and the outline of a shape
(open or closed) can be traced by dragging the pen in
either straight lines or curves.
<p>
Paths represent an outline of an object which is defined in terms of:
<UL>
<LI>moveto (set a new current point)</LI>
<LI>lineto (draw a straight line)</LI>
<LI>curveto (draw a curve using a cubic bezier)</LI>
<LI>arc (elliptical or circular arc)</LI>
<LI>closepath (close the current shape by
drawing a line to the last moveto)
</UL>
<p>
Compound paths (i.e., a path with subpaths,
each consisting of a
single moveto followed by one or more line or curve operations)
are possible to allow effects such as "donut holes" in objects.
</p>

<XMP><path d="M 100 100 L 140 100 L 120 140 z"/></XMP>

	<p>

When you start a path entity,if some paths already exist a dialog box
give you the possibility to recall a previous path for modifications
if no Id is given the internal name will be formed with "path" plus the
entity number eg: path2

 <UL>
 <LI><b>Image</b><p>
The user can load an image on background to help in drawing.
 <LI><b>MoveTo</b><p>
The "moveto" command establish a new current point.
The effect is as if the "pen" were lifted and moved to a new location.
 A path data segment must begin with the "moveto" command
<br>
 Line mode is the default operation following the initial Move unless
 a different operation is selected.
 </LI>
 <LI><b>Insert</b><p>
 To insert a command after or before the point selected, this point can only be
 either a start or an end point not a control point.
 </LI>
 <LI><b>Arc</b><p>
 An elliptical arc segment draws a segment of an ellipse.
 </LI>
 <LI><b>Cubic curve</b><p>
 A cubic bezier segment is defined by a start point, an end point, and two control points.
 <br>A quadratic bezier segment is defined by a start point, an end point, and one control point.
 </LI>
 <LI><b>Close</b><p>
Will close the last point to the first point to create a closed path
The Path can also be terminated and closed by selecting the first point.
The "closepath"  causes an automatic straight line to be drawn from
the current point to the initial point of the current subpath.

 </LI>
 <LI><b>Change origin</b><p>
 Normally the points are relative to (0,0), but in many case the user to
 help in positionning or to rotate the path, want to use either the
 center point or the left low corner of the bounding box.
 </LI>
 <LI><b>New Path</b>
 </LI>
 <LI><b>End</b><p>
 Leave the drawing in the state open
 </LI>
</UL>

	<p>
	
  A small cross is used to mark the points.

	<p class="sub">Selection Modification</p>
	<p>
	
  As soon as the user select a point a start or an end(easier) it's the normal
  Magelan modification handling

	<p class="sub">Special gestures</p>
	<p>

If the cursor is on a point the cursor change to "CROSS_HAIR".
If you use Ctrl plus right button you get the move cursor and you can drag the
point.<br>
If you use shift plus right button you delete the point if it is a start or end point
and no the first moveto.
