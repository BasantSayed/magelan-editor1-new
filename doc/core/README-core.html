	<p class="title">Overview</p>
	<p>The Magelan project aims to provide a set of easy to use and
	incorporate Java 2D vector graphics editor components.
	<p>
	It is divided into two parts: <br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>core</b><p>
		The core library defines powerful drawing and editor 
		models, as well as basic viewer and editor <i>Swing</i> components. 
		It is intended as a platform for the development of 
		graphics editors and related products. <p>
		The library is 
		also very convenient to use for all kinds of visualisation
		tasks and in applications where simple graphical 
		user input is required. If more complex behavior is 
		required, the editor library should be used.<p>
		The editor <i>Swing</i> component features 
		selection and drag and drop editing of entities (stretching and 
		moving). <p>
		The core comes with a set of 
		pre-defined entities. It includes not only basic entities like lines, 
		circles, polylines, etc. but a number of more sophisticated ones 
		like dynamic labels, which display a chosen property of an entity; 
		block definitions and views. <p>
		Finally, the offered drawing and
		editor models are not only powerful and flexible, but very 
		easy to use and extend, and new entities are simple to write.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>editor</b><p>
		The editor uses and further extends the drawing and
		editor models, defined in the core library, and
		provides a basic stand-alone editor implementation. <p>
		A number of editor extensions (tools) are included in
		it. They allow the user to create and edit 
		graphical entities, as well as to navigate 
		through the drawing and perform various operations on it. <p>
		The editor supports a number of file formats, most notably
		it is able to read and write basic <i>DXF</i> files. It can
		also export drawings to <i>EPS</i> and <i>SVG</i> formats. <p>
		Extensions are very easy to create, maintain and plug 
		into the editor component.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b><u>Note:</u></b> For more information regarding the editor, 
	please refer to the documentation bundled with it.
	<p>
	
	<p class="title">License<p>
	The <b>core</b> library is licensed under a 
	<a href="LICENSE.txt">BSD License</a>. 
	Use only subject to the terms of this license agreement.
	<p>

	<p class="title">Distribution Package</p>
		<p>
		The structure of the distribution package is as follows: <br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>bin</b> folder, containing <b>magelan-core.jar</b> with the compiled and ready 
			for use library;</li>
			<li><b>src</b> folder, containing all source files;</li>
			<li><b>doc</b> folder, containing all documentation, 
			including <i>JavaDoc</i>s;</li>
			<li><b>lib</b> folder, containing all necessary 
			libraries;</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		To see a demo of the library, execute the <b>magelan-core.jar</b> 
		file. <p>
		<b><u>Note:</b></u> the <b>magelan-commons.jar</b> file from <b>/lib</b> 
		must be placed in the same folder as the <b>magelan-core.jar</b> file.
		<p>

			The project features a simple to use but very flexible and easily 
			extendible vector graphics framework. It allows efficient rendering of thousands of entities.
			It is inherently similar to the <b>core</b> library. To bring the similarities further, some of
			the excellent design solutions of <b>JDrawing</b> were implemented in this library.
